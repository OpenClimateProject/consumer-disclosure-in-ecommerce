# Consumer Disclosure in Ecommerce Customer Journeys

**Prompt category: Networked Climate Markets** \
**Prompt: Consumer Disclosure Contracts for Sustainable Supply Chains**

## What’s the problem?
- Unsustainable supply chains contribute to environmental footprints
- Develop a model to track supply chains and rebalance the information asymmetry 

## What’s the solution?

## Mission 
To develop and prototype a product that the WG community deems worthy to address consumer disclosure gaps between products and its end-users (the mainstream audience) and foster more sustainable supply chains. To build on top of previous efforts around the e-commerce entry point for user adoption.
