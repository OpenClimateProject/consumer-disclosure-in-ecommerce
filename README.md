## Existing body of work

Considerable work has been done during 2019 team contributions and research work of several that has led to progress in the development of several e-commerce related concepts \

- **Consumer Disclosure Contracts for Sustainable Supply Chains**
Addresses the following problem:
    - Unsustainable supply chains contribute to environmental footprints
    - Develop a model to track supply chains and rebalance the information asymmetry 

As a solution it proposes a disclosure framework from primary material upto the finished product delivered to the customer .

- **Informing the customer in E-commerce : browser extension** 
 - A browser extension concept that lets consumers understand the environmental and social impact of the purchases they are going to make

- **Enabling the consumer offseting his/ her C impact**
